# About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://Utthaanfest.netlify.app/)

A website for a space-themed college fest. The website allows you to login either as a user or as an admin.

A user can register themselves using a valid email id and a strong password. A verification mail is then sent on their email. Once verified, the user can register to the many events of the Utthaan fest. Users can also register for exciting pronites and buy fest-themed goodies. Users can see the list of events, pronites and goodies they have registered for in their user panel.

An admin can log in to their account with the proper credentials. Only admins have access to the admin panel. Admin panel displays a list of all the users registered on the website. Admins can also view the list of events, pronites and goodies the users have registered for. Moreover, the admin panel shows the most popular event, the most popular pronite show and the most popular goodie on their corresponding pages.

### **Security**
---
- SQL Injection
  - User is logged in to site through E-mail Verification system.
  - We used parameterized queries and input validation to prevent SQL Injection attacks.
- User Authentication
  - We added Password Validation for users to enter strong passwords.
  - Passwords are not stored as plain-texts they are hashed and salted then stored in the database.
  - No critical information like the password of the user is sent into the session.
  - We enable OAuth 2.0 via Google Cloud's Gmail API v1 to get access to user's email in a secure delegated manner.
 - Cross-Site Scripting Attacks
   - We enabled CORS to permit loading of resources from other sites.
   - We enabled Helmet in our backend which prevents our website from XSS attacks upto some extent.
   - Helmet provieds our site with Content-Security-Policy (CSP) which also prevents XSS attacks.

> We enabled compression middleware to compress response bodies for all request that traverse through the middleware.
